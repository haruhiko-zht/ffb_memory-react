FFB memory

[This](https://haruhiko.xsrv.jp/FFB/) is my strategy site for FF BATTLE that an old cgi game.

To learn TypeScript and React, this site is being renewing.

## Learn TypeScript and React

This site will be my first React App, and I am focusing creating UI Components. So, I maybe don't use redux and asynchronous stacks (ex. redux middleware, suspense) and so on.

Splitting HTML codes to UI components (UI Components design) is very difficult for me, but I try hard because I am interested in React.
